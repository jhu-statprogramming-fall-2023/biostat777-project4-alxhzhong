# Statistical Computing, Project 4

Hello! This dashboard explores changes in transportation mode use in Chicago and Los Angeles over the pandemic (2019-2021). 

This dashboard was created using flexdashboard, Shiny, and plotly. Data used comes from the U.S. Census Bureau/[American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) and was obtained using the [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) API.

You can access the dashboard here on shinyapps: https://alxhzhong.shinyapps.io/chicago_la_transit/.
